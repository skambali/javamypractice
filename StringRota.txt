/*
 s1 and s2 are two given strings, then write a java program to check whether s2 is a rotated version of s1?

Examples

If “JavaJ2eeStrutsHibernate” is a string then below are some rotated versions of this string.

“StrutsHibernateJavaJ2ee”, “J2eeStrutsHibernateJava”, “HibernateJavaJ2eeStruts”.

Solution

Step 1 Check whether s1 and s2 are of same length. If they are not of same length then s2 is not rotated version of s1.

Step 2 s3 = s1 + s1;

If s1 = “JavaJ2eeStrutsHibernate” then s3 = “JavaJ2eeStrutsHibernateJavaJ2eeStrutsHibernate”.
Step 3  Check whether s3 contains s2 using contains() method of String class. If it contains then s2 is rotated version of s1.*/
